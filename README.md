# Udacity-Object-Oriented_JavaScript

This repository contains my project of a classic arcade game Frogger when learning the [Object-Oriented JavaScript](https://www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-javascript--ud015) course at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com). My work is mainly in the js/app.js file. The other files are provided by the course. 

To run and play the game, double-click on the index.html file in the project folder. Details of the project are provided below.

===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).
